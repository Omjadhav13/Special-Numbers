# Special-Numbers
A number is said to be a special number if the sum of the factorial of the digits in the number is equal to the number itself
The factorial of each digit in the number is calculated and is added to a variable called sum. After the factorial of all the digits has been calculated, the sum is compared with the original number. If both of them are equal, the number is said to be a special number.

Example: 145 is said to be a special number. Since,1!+ 4!+ 5! = 145, it is a special number. Calculations- 1! = 1,4!=24 and 5!=120 after adding them, 1+24+120 we get 145.Hence we can say it is special number.
